# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

# The idea(s) that I have for my final project is to design a game that can be played between the user and AI. The first game idea is a guessing game creating random numbers and names for the user to guess. The second game idea is a popular card game called "Uno" which is played between the user and AI. The objective of the game is to win by having no cards left. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

# I will be doing the project alone without any collboration

## Do you have any questions of your own?

# At this time, I do not have any questions or concerns
