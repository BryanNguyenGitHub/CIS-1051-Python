# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

# The title of my project is called "What Am I Thinking of?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

# The game that would be played between the user and the computer. Overall, the program would allow the user to guess objects in different categories. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

# First, the overall of the game is to implement a random module program which implements different items in the list. The program would be also using while loops and condtionals and getting the user input within. The objective of the game is having the user guess some random output questions the cumputer will ask. This could either be numbers, words, etc. If the user guesses the question right, the pogram will have the out saying "here is your prize" or having the user win points such as money or points for guessing it right!

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

# Since my project is not that complex nor personally, I do not think it will take long to finish. I would say a good outcome of the project will be completing the random module and having the code execute by asking the user questions. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# I think I can accomplish learning how to create a function module which generate a random list. The part of the program can be execute by having the computer ask the user a random output question.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# I hope to to accomplish have the program execute by having the computer ask the user, and allowing the user guess the question. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

# Throughtout this course, I believe I have adapt the basic fundemental Python programming skills. In order for me to acheive the project I will need to know how to create a function, while loops, strings, input random, and making a list. I will be using videos or browsing certain skills either for a refresher!
